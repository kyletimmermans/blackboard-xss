# CVE-2020-9008

### A stored Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in Blackboard Learn/CloudPeopleTool v9.1 Q2 2017 CU5

</br>

#### Description:
Remote attackers have the ability to inject arbitrary web script via the `Tile` widget (aka profile-tiles) input forms located in their `People Tool` profile. The input is not properly sanitized and will be stored on the attacker's profile.

</br>

#### Impact:
An arbitrary script may be executed on the user's web browser (CWE-79).

</br>

#### Affected Versions:
Version 9.1 Q2 2017 Cumulative Update 5 (Build: 3200.0.5-rel.6+3dd6b56) and earlier versions that include the `Tile` widget in the profile editor

ui.cloudbb.blackboard.com/profiles/me |
fordham.blackboard.com/webapps/bb-social-learning-bb_bb60/execute/mybb?cmd=display&toolId=CloudCoreGateOnMyBb_____CloudPeopleTool |

</br>

#### Steps to Reproduce:
1. To exploit the vulnerability, the attacker must enter a <script> open and </script> close tag in the "MAJOR" tile widget at their
profile customization page at `https://ui.cloudbb.blackboard.com/profiles/me`
2. On submission, the script is stored in the profile's public page. Thus, whenever the profile is visited, the script tags are interpreted and any Javascript code between the two script tags is executed on the visitor's browser. Also, hovering over the attacker's icon in the `My Learning Network` at `https://example.blackboard.com/webapps/bb-social-learning-bb_bb60/execute/mybb?cmd=display&toolId=CloudCoreGateOnMyBb_____CloudPeopleTool` also causes the code to be executed on the visitor's browser.
